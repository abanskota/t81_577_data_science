# T81 577 Applied Data Science for Practitioners

[Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/)

Instructor: Asim Banskota

Spring 2021, Wednesday, 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM , Cupples II, Room L015

# Course Description

Organizations are rapidly transforming the way they ingest, integrate, store, serve data, and perform
analytics. In this course, students will learn the steps involved with designing and implementing data
science projects. Topics addressed include: ingesting and parsing data from various sources, dealing with
messy and missing data, transforming and engineering features, building and evaluating machine learning models, and
visualizing results. Using Python based tools such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, students will
complete a practical data science project that addresses the entire design and implementation process.
Students will also become familiar with the best practices and current trends in data science including
code documentation, version control, reproducible research, pipeline automation, and cloud computing. Upon completion of the course, students will emerge equipped with data science knowledge and skills that can be applied from day one on the job.
