### In this assignment, you will install Anaconda, test packages, and start a Jupyter Notebook server.

#### 1. Anaconda installation (Points 3.5)

Go to the _Installing Python_ section here and follow the instructions to install Anaconda for **Python3** on your computer.

- Once installed, open anaconda prompt and test whether the _numpy_ and _pandas_ library exists by first running the python interpreter and then importing pandas and numpy in the python prompt.

- Check whether _pillow_ library exists, if not, install using conda.

- Capture a screenshot that clearly shows successful import of _numpy_, _pandas_, and _pillow_ packages 

#### 2. Jupyter Notebook (Points 1.5)

- Start a Jupyter Notebook server

- Open a new Python3 notebook

- Rename the file as `your-last-name.ipynb`

- Turn the first cell type to Markdown and type `Testing Jupyter Notebook`

- type in the subsequent cell:

```python
print('whatever u like')
```
- Take a snapshot that clear shows the name of the notebook, and the first two cells you played with.
